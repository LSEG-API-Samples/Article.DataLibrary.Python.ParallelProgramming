# Leveraging Parallel Programming in Python for Optimized Server Data Retrieval

Concurrency and parallelism are two topics which can be challenging for beginners and sometimes even misunderstood by professionals. They are often used in relation to multi-threaded or parallel programming. Both may seem to refer to the same or similar concepts on the surface. However, they are typically used to specify different types of multi-threaded behavior.

This article will provide you a deep understanding on those topics, how they can be used in python and finally some practical samples using the Refinitiv Data Library.

Refer to the [Leveraging Parallel Programming Article](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/leveraging-parallel-programming-in-python) defined within the LSEG Developer Community for more details.
